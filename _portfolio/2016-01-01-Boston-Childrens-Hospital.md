During 2016, I worked with a team of other students at UConn to create scenes for an interactive wall installation at Boston Childrens Hospital. The system consists of a roughly 20 by 30 foot LED wall and several Microsoft Kinects and webcams that can detect the positions and gestures of people in front of the wall. My role has been to come up with the best way to create animations for several characters in an animated scene and do that animation.

I worked on a motion capture workflow for about half of a year, but it was ultimately decided that the best results would come from doing manual animation. I was responsible for modeling one character, the facade of the building, and rigging and animating three of the characters. Videos of each character are shown below.
