This project was the product of an independent study I worked on during the fall semester of 2015. We worked as a client for Diversified Media Group (DMG). The team I worked with consisted of me, Michael Toomey, Christian Wanamaker, Thomas Lee, [http://katekormushoff.com](Kate Kormushoff), and Jake Vig. My role in the project was to develop some of the interaction concepts for the cursor, develop the visual style and corresponding assets for the scene, and to do the materials and lighting for the scenes that contained 3D elements. I also did a small amount of UI/UX design.

The goal of the project was to develop an interactive retail experience to promote a project. Mazda was chosen as a model product and did not sponsor the project in any way. The hardware consisted of a single Microsoft Kinect for XBox One and a display. Users interact through pointing and swiping gestures. The experience consists of several scenes designed to attract the user to the display, and then let them explore various aspects of the product in ways that are more engaging than traditional touch screens or non-interactive video installations.
