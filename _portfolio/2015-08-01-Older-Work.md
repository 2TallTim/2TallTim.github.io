excerpt: Some older work, including video and animation experiments.

This is some of my older work, including video work and assorted 3D animation experiments.

## Mecha

A personal project that started as a small modelling exercise, but kept going. Modeled in Blender. Simple materials with no texture, rendered with a three point lighting setup. ~250,000 polygons. The leg design is intended to be mechanically plausible, with rotating joints for the upper and lower leg segments, and a parallel bar mechanism in the middle segment. The final render was done at 300 samples per pixel.

## Futuristic HUD

This project was inspired by the work of GMunk and others on movies like Enderâ€™s Game and Oblivion. The purpose of this personal project was to learn how to use shape layers to create interesting effects.

## Tiny UConn

This video was the final project for my Moving Image and Sequence class (DMD 2210) during the fall semester of 2015. The idea was initially pitched by Jamie Buck and voted to be produced by the entire class. The team consisted of me, [Jamie Buck](http://jamiewbuck.com/), Jake Vig, and Henry Stein. The concept was to have a video consisting of glamour shots of UConn taken from high vantage points and drones with a "tilt-shift" effect applied and sped up to make the scenery appear small. My role in the group was piloting my drone for the drone shots, doing some of the tilt-shift effect, and doing final color grading and rendering on the video.

## UConn in Infrared

These two videos were a personal project to test my skills with color grading and editing, as well as to test the capabilities of my (DIY) modified infrared camera in regards to video.
